# Random-Sentences-Generator

Welcome to the Random Sentence Generator! This simple Java program generates random sentences using predefined lists of names, places, verbs, nouns, adverbs, and details. The sentences follow a specific structure, combining elements from each category to create amusing and unique phrases.

## How It Works

The program constructs sentences using the following format:

- **Who from where:** `[Name] from [Place]`
- **Action:** `[Adverb] [Verb] [Noun]`
- **Detail:** A random detail from a list

An example sentence could be:  
*Taylor from New York rapidly drives the getaway car near the sea.*

## Features

- **Randomized Output:** Each sentence is randomly generated, ensuring a unique output every time.
- **User Interaction:** After each sentence, the program waits for the user to press [Enter] to generate a new one.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Program:** Execute the main class `RandomSentencesGenerator` to start the generator.
2. **Generate Sentences:** Press [Enter] to generate a new random sentence.

## Installation and Setup
To play the game, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone or download the repository containing the project files.
2. **Compile the Java File:** Use a Java compiler to compile the RandomSentencesGenerator.java` file.
